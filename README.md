## Creating a BigQuery Dashboard ##
### Running on AppEngine ###
This [codelab](https://developers.google.com/bigquery/articles/dashboard) describes how to build a dashboard application on top of Google BigQuery. Our specific implementation uses Google App Engine using Python and Google Charts using Javascript. The general strategy and techniques should be applicable to any platform and visualization package.

This is an intermediate lab and we assume you have already completed Part 1 of the Python Codelab or the Python App Engine Getting Started guide. That means you are already have your basic App Engine development environment configured and that you've successfully run a basic app on your system using the development server.
